        <div class="context-paragraph">
            <p>
                For this project, we were tasked to complete the full iterative design process in solving a design problem for the 
                startup <a href="https://www.modular.com/" target="_blank">Modular</a>. Specifically, we were given the task to improve the overall onboarding experience for Modular, and through 
                this process, we were able to create initial sketches, develop lo-fi and hi-fi designs through Figma, and receive feedback 
                from our client and our peers in the process. This webpage illustrates the journey that we went through, starting from our 
                initial sketches to our final high-fidelity mockups that we ended up presenting to design leads at Modular. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <h1 class="metric-head">Defining the Problem</h1>
        <div class="context-paragraph">
            <p>
                First, the main problem that we had was to improve the Modular onboarding process as Modular found that they were <span class="bold">losing around 50% of 
                    potential users</span> simply due to the complexity of the onboarding stage. The hypothesis behind this dropoff was due to the fact that the onboarding
                process was complicated and long, involving the use of a terminal to run commands. Additionally, the old onboarding process brought the user 
                to a plain <a href="https://docs.modular.com/max/" target="_blank">documentation page</a>. Therefore, there were two main problems that we wanted to solve: 
            </p>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li class="sub-bullet">Avoid having the user simply just visit the Modular documentation page. </li>
                <li class="sub-bullet">Figure out if we want the user flow to be "Create an Account" and then "Install the SDK" or "Install the SDK" first 
                    and then "Create an Account."
                </li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <p>Therefore, with these two main pain points in mind, we started our initial design process.</p>

            <p>One of the most important parts of this project was receiving feedback on our design. First, we were able to film a five minute

            <p>Next, we presented our Loom video to our peers in our Critique Design Studio. After presenting, our peers from different groups

                also made a presentation to <a href="https://www.gv.com/team/vanessa-cho" target="_blank">Vanessa</a> who provided some comments as well. We've collected our

                <li class="sub-bullet"><span class="bold">[Peer]</span>: "The documentation is a super long work flow, so people dont want to get through the entire process and never end up making the account - having both options could be good." </li>
                <li class="sub-bullet"><span class="bold">[Peer]</span>: "The phrase, "learn more" is slightly confusing, and the fact that the docs page is a different page could be a reason why users are dropping off."</li>
                <li class="sub-bullet"><span class="bold">[Peer]</span>: "Might be useful to give preview of what learn more is going to do, rather than just learn more, give more info about what to expect."</li>
                <li class="sub-bullet"><span class="bold">[Peer]</span>: "Maybe it could be possible to automate the process for the user (let the program run the commands for the user)"</li>
                <li class="sub-bullet"><span class="bold">[Vanessa]</span>: "Maybe there could be an option of doing both flows, so one flow could be for people that know about Modular to immediately just create an account, and one flow could 
                    be for people that don't know too much about Modular, so they go through the "learn more" route."</li>
                <li class="sub-bullet"><span class="bold">[Client]</span>: "If you want to psychologically nudge users towards account creation, then don't give the 2 options the same visual weight. Make the 'create account' feel like the primary choice,
                     and add some ROI to it 'Recommended option' or 'This option allows you to use Free credits for production deployment.'"</li>
                <li class="sub-bullet"><span class="bold">[Client]</span>: "I'd rebrand "Learn More" as 'test MAX locally first' or some language that is a stronger outcome than just learning, but implies that it's another way to try MAX."</li>

                    simply improve the onboarding flow, we kept most of the colors consistent to what is currently found on the website. Additionally,
