            <p >The main purpose of this project is to use competitive analysis with three different websites to create a well-rounded application that 
                can filter, sort, and aggregate data. In order to create this application, I will be using React.js to create an interactive interface which 
                will include interactive components and tie components to an internal data state. If these concepts such as competitive analysis or React.js components 
                don't make sense, scroll down to get a deeper overview of what this project is trying to accomplish!

    <section id="p1"class="p1">
        <h1 class="part1">Part 1: Competitive Analysis</h1>
        <div class="context-paragraph">
            <p>
                First off, what is competitive analysis? Competitive analysis is the process of researching competitors to gain insight on their own performance. In this project, 
                I conducted competitive analysis on three different websites containing a similar favoriting function. The theme that I am exploring is clothing stores across the three 
                websites. This is because I like to do retail therapy whenever I am stressed by scrolling through different clothing websites, but due to my lack of commitment, I rarely
                buy anything. Therefore, the three websites that I am exploring are shown below: 
        </div>
        <div class="websites-contain">
            <div class="web-img">
                <h1>H&M</h1>
                <img src="assets/h&m.png" alt="h&m">
            </div>
            <div class="web-img">
                <h1>Gap</h1>
                <img src="assets/gap.png" alt="gap">
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="websites-contain">
            <div class="web-img">
                <h1>Uniqlo</h1>
                <img src="assets/uniqlo.png" alt="uniqlo">
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="context-paragraph">
            <p>
                As you can see in the three screenshots above, the three websites that I chose are H&M, Gap, and Uniqlo. In order to compare 
                the competitive advantages in each of these three websites, we will create a Competitive Comparison Chart, which is essentially 
                a comparison table, that is shown below: 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="websites-contain">
            <div class="web-img">
                <h1>Competitive Comparison Chart</h1>
                <img src="assets/ccc.png" alt="competitive-chart">
            </div>
        </div>
        <h3 class="metric-head">Summary</h1>
        <div class="context-paragraph">
            <span class="underline">Summary</span>: After studying the three websites, I reached the following conclusions: 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span class="underline">Most Successful</span>: The most successful feature was being able to filter different clothing sizes
                    on the main webpage. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="underline">Justification</span>: Since all of the websites are clothing apparel companies, this feature was expected from me as 
                    all three websites had this functionality. The main design principle here is to maximize usability in the interface where usability is the 
                    attribute that looks at how easy it is for the user to use an interface. Since it is the expectation of the user to have a filtering option, to increase
                    usability, a lot of websites would have this functionality which is the justification as to why it is the most successful feature on the chart.  
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                    <span class="underline">Least Successful</span>: The least successful feature was being able to place all of the favorited items 
                    (using the favoriting function) into the shopping cart aggregator for checkout. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="underline">Justification</span>: This was surprising as none of the websites had this 
                    functionality, but this was one of the features that I thought would be convenient to have inside of the favoriting function interface. The justification 
                    as to why this might be is that companies did not feel that this feature was a high enough priority. This leads us back to the in-class activity that we did on
                    3/12, where we were asked to pick which features that we thought were most important to complete in a current sprint with a limited amount of hours to complete 
                    such features. Therefore, the design practice that might explain this is that designers for these websites prioritized other features, leaving this feature of the chart 
                    on the chopping block. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3 class="metric-head">List of Features</h1>
        <div class="context-paragraph">
            <span class="underline">List of Features</span>: Based off my competitive analysis, the list of features that I will attempt to implement in my React application 
            will be the following: 
            <br>
            <br>
            <ul class="lof-list">
                <li>Ability to filter different clothing items</li>
                <li>Ability to favorite a clothing item</li>
                <li>Ability to place a clothing item in a shopping cart</li>
                <li>Ability to sort items by price</li>
                <li>Ability to filter items by price</li>
                <li>Ability to filter items by whether they are a top or a bottom piece</li>
                <li>Reset filter/sorting functionality</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>One clarification that I wanted to make is that the favorited list and the shopping cart are separate. There could be items that 
                are favorited inside of the shopping cart, but there could also be items that are not favorited that are inside of the shopping cart as well. 
                These two lists are kept separate to help the user finalize their decisions.

            <br>
            <span class="underline">Planning</span>: Based off my competitive analysis in the seciton above, I want to create my own version 
            of a clothing apparel site that incorporates all of the features that are listed inside of the "List of Features" section above. Additionally,
            this will be the ways that I incorporate filter, sort, and aggregation below: 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span class="underline">Filter</span>: For filtering, you will be able to filter based off certain criteria which will include filtering 
                    for just top pieces (i.e., shirts, sweatshirts) and for bottoms(i.e., pants, shorts). Additionally, we can filter based off of price!
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="underline">Sort</span>: For sorting, you will be able to sort based off price, so you will be able to sort via the highest price
                    and the lowest price as well. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="underline">Aggregation</span>: For aggregation, there will be an option on each clothing item to favorite the clothing item. Additionally, 
                    there will be an option to add an item to a shopping cart where a subtotal will be calculated!
                </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>First, to favorite an item, you click on the heart icon on the specific item card. This change will be reflected in the favorites aggregator.</li>
                <li>Second, when filtering via price, whenever you type in a price, the items that are <span class="underline">less than or equal</span> to the 
                price inputted will be outputted in the items on the left. </li>
                <li>Third, when filtering, it is possible to filter via both price and tops/bottoms. However, it is not possible to filter for both tops and bottoms as 
                    it is not possible for an item to be both a top piece and a bottom piece in this store. Therefore, if you click on filter tops and then filter botoms or vice 
                    versa, nothing will show up on the screen. To filter tops and then filter bottoms, you need to reset in between to go back to an unfiltered state. 
                </li>
