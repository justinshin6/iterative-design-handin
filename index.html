        <div class="context-paragraph">
            <p>
                For this project, we were tasked to complete the full iterative design process in solving a design problem for the 
                startup <a href="https://www.modular.com/" target="_blank">Modular</a>. Specifically, we were given the task to improve the overall onboarding experience for Modular, and through 
                this process, we were able to create initial sketches, develop lo-fi and hi-fi designs through Figma, and receive feedback 
                from our client and our peers in the process. This webpage illustrates the journey that we went through, starting from our 
                initial sketches to our final high-fidelity mockups that we ended up presenting to design leads at Modular. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <h1 class="metric-head">Defining the Problem</h1>
        <div class="context-paragraph">
            <p>
                First, the main problem that we had was to improve the Modular onboarding process as Modular found that they were <span class="bold">losing around 50% of 
                    potential users</span> simply due to the complexity of the onboarding stage. The hypothesis behind this dropoff was due to the fact that the onboarding
                process was complicated and long, involving the use of a terminal to run commands. Additionally, the old onboarding process brought the user 
                to a plain <a href="https://docs.modular.com/max/" target="_blank">documentation page</a>. Therefore, there were two main problems that we wanted to solve: 
            </p>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li class="sub-bullet">Avoid having the user simply just visit the Modular documentation page. </li>
                <li class="sub-bullet">Figure out if we want the user flow to be "Create an Account" and then "Install the SDK" or "Install the SDK" first 
                    and then "Create an Account."
                </li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <p>Therefore, with these two main pain points in mind, we started our initial design process.</p>

        <span class="bold">Design Decisions</span>: Here are some of the major design decisions that were made:
        <br>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li class="sub-bullet"><span class="bold">Flow One vs. Flow Two</span>: Initially, we made two user-flows. One was focused on having the user create an account and then install the application locally. We called 
                this <span class="bold">Flow One</span>.
                The second user-flow had the user install the application locally first, test it, and then create an account afterwards. We called this <span class="bold">Flow Two</span>. We felt that the former would 
                be users that have experienced the Modular application before while the latter would be helpful for users that haven't played around with the application before. 
                Therefore, this is what led us to our main proposed design. 
            </li>
            <li class="sub-bullet"><span class="bold">Forked User Flow</span>: Our main design that we reflected in our Lo-Fi Wireframe was actually to combine Flow One and Flow Two 
            to create a <span class="bold">Forked User Flow</span> that appeals to users that are both familiar and unfamiliar with the platform. Instead of choosing which 
        user-flow that would appeal to all users, we made the design choice to give that choice to the user so that they can get the most out of the platform based off their familiarity with the 
    product. Then at the end, all users will end at the same position which would be the user's personal dashboard.</li>
    <li class="sub-bullet"><span class="bold">User Dashboard</span>: The final main design choice was changing the user's personal dashboard after they created an account to be a checklist to ensure that the user has followed
        all of the necessary steps to set up the application locally. This also solves the problem of just directing the user to the documentation page.

        <div class="context-paragraph">
            <p>One of the most important parts of this project was receiving feedback on our design. First, we were able to film a five minute 
                Loom video that demonstrates our design flow. 
            </p>
            <div class="button-contain">

            <p>Next, we presented our Loom video to our peers in our Critique Design Studio. After presenting, our peers from different groups 
                provided feedback on our initial design flow. Additionally, we presented our Loom video to our client who provided us with additional feedback. Finally, we
                also made a presentation to <a href="https://www.gv.com/team/vanessa-cho" target="_blank">Vanessa</a> who provided some comments as well. We've collected our

                <li class="sub-bullet"><span class="bold">[Peer]</span>: "The documentation is a super long work flow, so people dont want to get through the entire process and never end up making the account - having both options could be good." </li>
                <li class="sub-bullet"><span class="bold">[Peer]</span>: "The phrase, "learn more" is slightly confusing, and the fact that the docs page is a different page could be a reason why users are dropping off."</li>
                <li class="sub-bullet"><span class="bold">[Peer]</span>: "Might be useful to give preview of what learn more is going to do, rather than just learn more, give more info about what to expect."</li>
                <li class="sub-bullet"><span class="bold">[Peer]</span>: "Maybe it could be possible to automate the process for the user (let the program run the commands for the user)"</li>
                <li class="sub-bullet"><span class="bold">[Vanessa]</span>: "Maybe there could be an option of doing both flows, so one flow could be for people that know about Modular to immediately just create an account, and one flow could 
                    be for people that don't know too much about Modular, so they go through the "learn more" route."</li>
                <li class="sub-bullet"><span class="bold">[Client]</span>: "If you want to psychologically nudge users towards account creation, then don't give the 2 options the same visual weight. Make the 'create account' feel like the primary choice,
                     and add some ROI to it 'Recommended option' or 'This option allows you to use Free credits for production deployment.'"</li>
                <li class="sub-bullet"><span class="bold">[Client]</span>: "I'd rebrand "Learn More" as 'test MAX locally first' or some language that is a stronger outcome than just learning, but implies that it's another way to try MAX."</li>

            <ul>

                <li class="sub-bullet">Second, on the "Create an Account" page, we added information as to why the user should be incentivized to create an account (i.e., free 
                    credits to deploy their model to the cloud).
                </li>
                <li class="sub-bullet">Third, we changed the visual hierarchy of the "Create an Account" button when compared to the "Test MAX Locally First" to try to 
                    incentivize users to create an account early.
                </li>

                    <span class="bold">Description</span>: The reason why we chose these particular fonts and colors is mainly because we wanted to maintain consistency. We didn't 
                    want to dramatically change the colors and fonts that already existed inside of the Modular design. Since our main job was to 
                    simply improve the onboarding flow, we kept most of the colors consistent to what is currently found on the website. Additionally, 
                    we made sure that this visual style guide was used throughout our Hi-Fi prototype. 
                </li>
                <li class="sub-bullet"><span class="bold">Hi-Fi Wireframe</span>: Next, click on the button below to take a look at our Hi-Fi wireframe. Specifically,

                <p><span class="bold">Description</span>: Overall, we didn't make too many drastic design changes from the Lo-Fi Wireframe to here. Some important points 
                that we wanted to mention was that first, we wanted to make the modal the same theme as the background-color of the webpage. Second, we incorporated the changes 
            to the visual hierarchy that we elaborated on in the previous section. In the end, our final solution that we presented to our client was the forked-approach that 
        allowed both users that were familiar and unfamiliar with the platform to follow through a similar onboarding experience. Additionally, we made a Loom video
